With the trendiest, freshest, and most unique styles from across India and the world, AJIO invites you to express your personal style fearlessly, and with a confidence and optimism that cannot be easily shaken.
AJIO OWN
AJIO OWN is our private label – that’s designed by us, and owned by you. If you’re looking for head-turning styles that are one-of-a-kind, AJIO OWN is what you should stock up on.
Exclusive International Labels
We bring you the trendiest and most exclusive brands from around the world to your wardrobe. Forget scouring the net for what’s hot globally, we’ve got you covered.
 

Why let a world that loves to police your wardrobe and your expression get the upper hand, anyway?
So the next time someone says ‘Oh, that dress is too bold’ ‘Are you sure you’re the right size for this?’ ‘Maybe you should pick a colour that suits you’ or ‘Act your age and wear something else’, go ahead and do exactly what you please. When it comes to great style and personal expression, there should never be any regrets.
 

Capsule Collections
If there’s an occasion to express your personal style, we’ve got a capsule collection to match. Shopping for a specific mood, event or style story has never been easier.
The Indie Experience
Our Indie styles are literally art you can wear. They are carefully handpicked, so that only the most authentic, handcrafted pieces by artisans across the country and globe make the cut.
